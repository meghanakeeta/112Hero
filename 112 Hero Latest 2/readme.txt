Project Name: 112 Hero

Description: 112 Hero is a version of guitar hero where the user can design 
their character, pick a song and perform their songs by playing the notes on
a guitar in real life that is connected to the game. 
In the beginning the user can pick what they are wearing and then the 
character will show on the side while the user is playing the notes on 
the guitar. Then the user can pick a song from a selection of songs.
The actual notes that the player plays are algorithmically determined
based on the beat of the song. Then the game ends and score shows. If the 
score is the high score it will get saved as the high score.
